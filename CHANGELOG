The following changes were made to the original games / intros:

All c128 BASIC games:
 - Start at $1c01 instead of $4001. They work with BLOAD and LOAD"",8,1 as well


Race:
  - Intro: fixed race condition with timer. Works as expected
  - Sets bank (JSR $FF68) before calling LOAD (JSR $FFD5)


Teenage Mutant Runner Turtle:
  - Sets bank (JSR $FF68) before calling LOAD (JSR $FFD5)


Puncher:
  - Autoloader ends at $0301 and not $0302 causing a crash
  - Sets bank (JSR $FF68) before calling LOAD (JSR $FFD5)
  - Right Player (file "AAAC") calls `JSR $25EF` instead of `JSR $21EF` to
  make the player self-contained.


Roketo:
  - Works with LOAD and DLOAD. Does not use varibles stored in $1102 by BLOAD


El Cruce:
  - Works with LOAD + DLOAD. Does not rely on filename i $1102 stored by BLOAD
  - Starts at $1c01 instead of $1c00


Intros C64:
  - Most of them were exomized to make them easier to run. Some intros were
  loaded at address $0800 making them very difficult to run.


Intros C128:
  - (unmodified) Require manual sys to run.


complete_rq_games_64:
  - fixed separators

complete_rq_games_128:
  - fixed separators
  - includes the fixed verion of the games
