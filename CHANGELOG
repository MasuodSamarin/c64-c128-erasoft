The following changes were made to the original games / intros:

c128 BASIC games:
 - Some of the BASIC games were using $4001 as the starting address.
   Changed to $1c01. Now it is possible to load them using BLOAD and LOAD"",8,1


Race:
  - Intro: fixed race condition with timer. Works as expected
  - Sets bank (JSR $FF68) before calling LOAD (JSR $FFD5)


Teenage Mutant Runner Turtle:
  - Sets bank (JSR $FF68) before calling LOAD (JSR $FFD5)


Puncher:
  - Autoloader ends at $0301 and not $0302, fixing a possible crash
  - Sets bank (JSR $FF68) before calling LOAD (JSR $FFD5)
  - Right Player (file "AAAC") calls `JSR $25EF` instead of `JSR $21EF` to
  make the player self-contained.


Roketo:
  - Works with LOAD and DLOAD. Does not use varibles stored in $1102 by BLOAD


El Cruce:
  - Works with LOAD + DLOAD. Does not rely on filename i $1102 stored by BLOAD
  - Starts at $1c01 instead of $1c00. Can be loaded with DLOAD and LOAD"",8


complete_rq_intros_c64.d64:
  - Most of them were exomized to make them easier to run since
    some intros were loaded at address $0800 making them very difficult to run.


complete_rq_games_c64:
  - fixed separators


complete_rq_games_c128:
  - fixed separators
  - includes the fixed verion of the games
  - converted from .d64 to .d71 to facilitate the loading in VICE
