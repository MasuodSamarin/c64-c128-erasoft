The following changes were made to the original games / intros:


Sex Games III:
 - starts at $1c01 and not $4001 make it possible to load it both with
   DLOAD"" (LOAD"*",8) and BLOAD"" (LOAD"*",8,1)


Race:
  - Intro: fixed race condition with timer. Works as expected
  - Sets bank (JSR $FF68) before calling LOAD (JSR $FFD5)


Teenage Mutant Runner Turtle:
  - Sets bank (JSR $FF68) before calling LOAD (JSR $FFD5)


Puncher:
  - Autoloader ends at $0301 and not $0302 causing a crash
  - Sets bank (JSR $FF68) before calling LOAD (JSR $FFD5)
  - Right Player (file "AAAC") calls `JSR $25EF` instead of `JSR $21EF` to
  make the player self-contained.


Chardef:
  - (unmodified)


The Race:
  - (unmodified)


Intros C64:
  - Most of them were exomized to make them easier to run. Some intros were
  loaded at address $0800 making them very difficult to run.


Intros C128:
  - (unmodified) Require manual sys to run.
