# "Erasoft" & "RQ progs" games, intros, etc.

A selection of my Commodore games, intros, trainers and recracks from '88 to '92 (for NTSC, although they might work on PAL as well)

# Intros

I also coded some intros. The better looking ones are these two intros:

## Intro 10 (NTSC only)

# Trainers

I did some trainers as well, like:

# Recracks

I also did some recracks. By that I mean: From a game, replace the intro done by someone else with another one done by myself.

COMING SOON

# Trivia

* Why that weird color palette? Because I developed them using a black-and-white TV. I never had the chance to play them on a color TV... until today :-)
* "RQ progs" comes from _Ricardo Quesada Programs_
* "Erasoft" comes from _Erasure_ + _software_. I used to be an Erasure fan back then
* My "circle + rectangle + triangle" logo is a _remix_ of the Electronic Arts logo from the 80's. I used to be an EA fan back then
* My Erasoft logos were based on Erasure logos
* One game is called _Race_ and another one is called _The Race_. Kind of confusing, right? A better name would have been _Race 2_.
* Each game was packed in a d71 image for convinience. Double-clicking on them should launch [VICE](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/) emulator. But they can be packed in a .d64 image if needed.
* All games were developed in a NTSC machine, so tell VICE to emulate NTSC video.
